# Long time, no release

Thanks to a contribution from @devlead, we are releasing 0.6.0 of Cake.ReSharperReports.  This includes the following:

## Improvements

- [__#22__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.ReSharperReports/issues/22) Update to latest Cake
- [__#20__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.ReSharperReports/issues/20) Switch away from using gep13.DefaultBuild and use Cake.Recipe instead
- [__#16__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.ReSharperReports/issues/16) Update nuspec with correct information

## Documentation

- [__#28__](https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.ReSharperReports/issues/28) Add Wyam Documentation generation

It was decided that this was required due to the fact that with the impending release of Cake 0.18.0 all addins need to be at least 0.16.0, so we decided to upload to the latest.

Please do not hesitate to reach out in the [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/cake-contrib/Lobby) if you have any issues using this addin.
